## ✨ About Me  
I grew up in Ormoc City, raised by two Math teachers—ironically, I never liked math much, but I still pursued **Computer Science** because of my love for **web development**.  

The idea of turning a design into a fully functional, interactive website excites me—especially when I can add smooth, captivating animations like those showcased on **Awwwards**.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me:  
- 🎮 Playing **Valorant** or **Genshin Impact**  
- 🎶 Mixing & making music (piano + guitar)  
- 📚 Watching anime, reading manga & web novels  
- 🛠️ Building side projects for fun & practice  

I’m **detail-oriented**, a strong **team player**, and always eager to **learn new technologies**.
